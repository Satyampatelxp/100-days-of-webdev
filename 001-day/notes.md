# Day 1 – HTML Basics and VS Code Shortcuts

## ✨ VS Code Shortcuts
```text
- Alt + Shift + Down Arrow → Duplicate the current line (useful for repeating tags like <h1>).
- Press Alt + Drag/Select → Multi-cursor editing, update many places at once.
- Alt + Change Tag Name → Quickly switch between tags (like <h1> to <h2>).
- Lorem → Generates dummy text (Lorem Ipsum).

## 🏗 Boilerplate Code
- Every HTML page starts with a boilerplate (basic structure).
- <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser we are using HTML5.
- <html>, <head>, and <body> are always required.

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

## 🔤 Headings
- HTML has 6 heading tags: <h1> to <h6>.
- <h1> is the largest, <h6> is the smallest.

Example:
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Sub Heading</h2>

## 📝 Comments
- Comments are used to add notes inside the code (not shown in browser).

Example:
<!-- This is a comment -->

## 🔗 Anchor Tag (Links)
- Used to create links in HTML.

Open in same tab:
<a href="https://example.com">Click Here</a>

Open in new tab:
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
